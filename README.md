### What is Houston?

##### Mission Control for your projects and team

Houston interfaces with your version-control, ticket-tracking, continuous integration, and other systems to stitch together a picture of your projects and teams.

It makes it easy to set up **triggers** and **notifications** like:

 - Resolving an exception report when a commit that mentions it is deployed
 - Slacking team members when a pull request is labeled or unlabeled
 - Notifying a committer when their commit breaks a test

And it provides a foundation for custom views like **dashboards** and **reports**.

Houston is also extensible through **modules**.



## Getting Started with Houston
