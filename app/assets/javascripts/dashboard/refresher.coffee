    # The function passed to attrTween is invoked for each selected element when
    # the transition starts, and for each element returns the interpolator to use
    # over the course of transition. This function is thus responsible for
    # determining the starting angle of the transition (which is pulled from the
    # element's bound datum, d.endAngle), and the ending angle (simply the
    # newAngle argument to the enclosing function).
    transition.attrTween 'd', (d)=>

      # To interpolate between the two angles, we use the default d3.interpolate.
      # (Internally, this maps to d3.interpolateNumber, since both of the
      # arguments to d3.interpolate are numbers.) The returned function takes a
      # single argument t and returns a number between the starting angle and the
      # ending angle. When t = 0, it returns d.endAngle when t = 1, it returns
      # newAngle and for 0 < t < 1 it returns an angle in-between.
      interpolate = d3.interpolate(d.endAngle, newAngle)

      # The return value of the attrTween is also a function: the function that
      # we want to run for each tick of the transition. Because we used
      # attrTween('d'), the return value of this last function will be set to the
      # 'd' attribute at every tick. (It's also possible to use transition.tween
      # to run arbitrary code for every tick, say if you want to set multiple
      # attributes from a single function.) The argument t ranges from 0, at the
      # start of the transition, to 1, at the end.

        # Calculate the current arc angle based on the transition time, t. Since
        # the t for the transition and the t for the interpolate both range from
        # 0 to 1, we can pass t directly to the interpolator.

        # Note that the interpolated angle is written into the element's bound
        # data object! This is important: it means that if the transition were
        # interrupted, the data bound to the element would still be consistent
        # with its appearance. Whenever we start a new arc transition, the
        # correct starting angle can be inferred from the data.
        d.endAngle = interpolate(t)

        # Lastly, compute the arc path given the updated data! In effect, this
        # transition uses data-space interpolation: the data is interpolated
        # (that is, the end angle) rather than the path string itself.
        # Interpolating the angles in polar coordinates, rather than the raw path
        # string, produces valid intermediate arcs during the transition.
