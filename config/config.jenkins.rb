  # Modules
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #
  # Modules provide a way to extend Houston.
  #
  # They are mountable Rails Engines whose routes are automatically
  # added to Houston's, prefixed with the name of the module.
  #
  # To create a new module for Houston, run:
  #
  #   gem install houston-cli
  #   houston_new_module <MODULE>
  #
  # Then add the module to this file with:
  #
  #   use :<MODULE>, github: "<USERNAME>/houston-<MODULE>", branch: "master"
  #
  # When developing a module, it can be helpful to tell Bundler
  # to refer to the local copy of your module's repo:
  #
  #   bundle config local.houston-<MODULE> ~/Projects/houston-<MODULE>
  #
  use :scheduler, :github => "houstonmc/houston-scheduler", :branch => "master"
  use :roadmap, :github => "houstonmc/houston-roadmap", :branch => "master"
  use :alerts, :github => "houstonmc/houston-alerts", :branch => "master"
  
  
  
  # What dependencies to check
  key_dependencies do
    gem "rails"
    gem "devise"
  end
  
  
  
  # Events:
  # Attach a block to handle any of the events broadcast by
  # Houston's event system:
  #   * antecedent:*:released   When a Ticket has been released, for each antecedent
  #   * antecedent:*:resolved   When a Ticket has been resolved, for each antecedent
  #   * antecedent:*:closed     When a Ticket has been closed, for each antecedent
  #   * boot                    When the Rails application is booted
  #   * deploy:completed           When a deploy has been recorded
  #   * hooks:*                 When a Web Hook as been triggered
  #   * release:create          When a new Release has been created
  #   * test_run:start          When the CI server has begun a build
  #   * test_run:complete       When the CI server has completed a build
  #   * testing_note:create     When a Testing Note has been created
  #   * testing_note:update     When a Testing Note has been updated
  #   * testing_note:save       When a Testing Note has been created or updated
  #   * ticket:release          When a Ticket is mentioned in a Release
  #
  # Example:
  # on "boot" do
  #   Airbrake.configure do |config|
  #     config.api_key          = AIRBRAKE_API_KEY
  #   end
  # end
